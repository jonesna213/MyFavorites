# My Favorites

## Goal
The goal of My Favorites is to essentially be an entertainment catalog which will start with Books and later expand to movies, tv shows, music, 
and maybe more. The point is to be able to look up any of your favorites in the search bar where then you can "save" them to your favorites list which
you would also be able to share with others. In addition to saving your favorites you will also be able to choose a few of your favorites to get a 
recommendation off of. For example, say you choose
a few sci-fi/horror books that you would like to read something similar too. You can choose a few of them and then say how close you want the 
recommendations to be to your choices. If you want them to be very similar it will give you a few recommendations that are similar, obviously the 
same concept with less similar. 

## MVP
The MVP for this will be essentially a library catalog where you can save your favorites. A very simple/minimalistic and easy to use layout. Like 
what was said above. I plan to expand this concept further to include other forms of entertainment.

## Technologies

### Front-End
For the front end I will be using the React.js framework for designing the website. For styling I plan to use bootstrap paired with some custom styles for a more professional and simplistic look.

### Back-End
For the back end I will be using Node.js framework paired with express for handling api requests. Since I am using node the whole application will be 
REST api based. This is a main reason for using React as the front end as it will make handling these requests and data much easier.
